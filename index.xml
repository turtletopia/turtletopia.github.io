      <description>Hi all!
I think it would be some aberration to start a programming blog with a post with any other title than &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
I am Dominik. I am a software developer and Data Science student (with the time of graduation approaching with high velocity). My friend Laura and I are passionate about programming in R. We love creating tools and playing with language to please others and ourselves (in any order).</description>

      <description>Hey, Laura and Dominik here!
We&amp;rsquo;ve studied and worked together on several R projects in many domains over the last few years. There were shiny apps, machine learning, bioinformatics, Rcpp, data visualization&amp;hellip; we can&amp;rsquo;t even list it all. And the time has come to share that knowledge.
We want to have a few types of blog posts: some talking about our experiences with certain packages/frameworks (looking at you, shiny!), some sharing obscure knowledge and R facts, some showing how to implement something in a given framework, and some giving an overview of existing solutions to certain problems.</description>
