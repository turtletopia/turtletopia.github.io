We&rsquo;ve studied and worked together on several R projects in many domains over the last few years. There were shiny apps, machine learning, bioinformatics, Rcpp, data visualization&hellip; we can&rsquo;t even list it all. And the time has come to share that knowledge.
We want to have a few types of blog posts: some talking about our experiences with certain packages/frameworks (looking at you, shiny!), some sharing obscure knowledge and R facts, some showing how to implement something in a given framework, and some giving an overview of existing solutions to certain problems."/>

      <p>Hey, Laura and Dominik here!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve studied and worked together on several R projects in many domains over the last few years. There were shiny apps, machine learning, bioinformatics, Rcpp, data visualization&hellip; we can&rsquo;t even list it all. And the time has come to share that knowledge.</p>
<p>We want to have a few types of blog posts: some talking about our experiences with certain packages/frameworks (looking at you, shiny!), some sharing obscure knowledge and R facts, some showing how to implement something in a given framework, and some giving an overview of existing solutions to certain problems. And maybe an occasional rambling about other languages (especially C++ due to the existence of Rcpp) as well.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for a post (especially How To and Overview post types), tag us <a href="https://twitter.com/Rturtletopia">on Twitter</a> or make an issue <a href="https://github.com/turtletopia/turtletopia.github.io/issues">on Github</a>.</p>
